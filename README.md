#  DJS03: React Podcast Landing Page  

This is my **React project** where I created a landing page for a podcast discovery app.  
It fetches podcast data from an external API and shows them in a clean, responsive grid.

##  What This Project Does
- Fetches podcast data from the [Podcast API](https://podcast-api.netlify.app/)  
- Shows a **loading screen** while fetching data  
- Handles errors and shows messages when something goes wrong  
- Displays podcasts in a **card layout** with:
  -  Podcast image  
  -  Title  
  - Number of seasons  
  -  Genre tags  
  -  Last updated date (formatted like “3 days ago”)  

---

##  Tech  Used
- **React** (functional components)  
- **Fetch API** for data fetching  
- **useEffect() & useState()** for state management  
- **.map()** to dynamically render podcast cards  
- **date-fns** (or custom formatter) to format dates  
- **CSS Grid / Flexbox** for layout  
- **Media Queries / Tailwind** for responsiveness  

---

##  Responsive Design
The app works smoothly on:
-  Desktop (≥1200px)  
-  Mobile (~375px)  
-  Tablet (~768px)
